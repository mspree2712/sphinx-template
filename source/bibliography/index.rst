Annotated Bibliography
======================

The documentation and tutorials provided on the React website [#f1]_ would be a
a great place to start. They cover what it is, how to get started understanding
React, and a multitude of other sources. I feel that it would be best to get
the information straight from the source to start.

I feel like it will be helpful to supplement the information from the ReactJS
website with the book, "React.js Book: Learning React Javascript Library From
Scratch". [#f2]_ I would be interested in reading how to get started from an opinion
aside from the developers.

An interesting article I found in EBSCO was an interview Facebook employees
where they talk about making React open source. [#f3]_ I think it would be
beneficial to get a sort of behind the scenes look from the developers
themselves.

The information provided in this video from UtahJS Conference [#f4]_ it
provides another introduction to React but in video format. I think that
this will help verbalize some of the things I may be confused about.

Finally, I feel like this crash course on React [#f5]_ will be a suitable
source as it will be another video format that provides additional insight
into React. The idea here is to gain multiple insights from different sources.
